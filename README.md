# Build a Similarity Search Engine for Images and Text in 1 Hour Using AI Models and Vector Databases

Welcome to the similarity search workshop! 
Imagine if you could build a search engine where you upload a picture to find similar content - like a shirt looking like one you saw online in a webshop - or get matching search results on similar descriptions, even if the actual text is different. This is what AI models and Vector Databases help you accomplish. In this session we will help you create and run a fully working search engine for vector-based text and image search using open source AI models and the free and open Elastic vector search engine!
